Our project involved developing a comprehensive Food Tracking App designed to help users monitor their dietary intake and make healthier food choices. We incentive the users to eat healthier by showing how many calories they have eaten so far this day with how many they should depending on their user settings.  For example,  if the user was trying to gain weight they would have a 3500 calorie surplus for the week to gain 1lb a week. Another feature in the app to help users stay on track eating good foods is by showing them how many macronutrients they have ate.

The app was built using the language Dart and the framework Flutter. We utilized Firebase Firestore for backend services, providing real-time database functionalities for keeping track of what users ate and their settings. We also employed an API in order to get the nutritional information from the food.

The development process was completed within a collaborative team framework, following Agile Scrum methodologies. This approach facilitated iterative progress, continuous feedback from the professor and peers, ensuring that the app met and exceeded the requirements. Furthermore, for source control we used GitHub to help facilitate collaboration in our scrum team.

Overall building the Food Tracking App helped solidify my knowledge with Dart, Flutter,  Firebase, and Agile Scrum.
